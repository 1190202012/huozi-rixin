As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data such as bed usage statistics by country. However, according to historical records, bedding became more widely used during the Middle Ages when people started using sheets made out of wool instead of linen. It wasn't until later centuries that beds began to take on their modern form, including mattresses and pillows. Bed use varied across different cultures throughout history but eventually spread globally due to advances in transportation and communication technology.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, while there may not be specific information regarding the popularity of beds in France and Germany at this time, historically speaking, bedding first took shape around the middle ages before becoming widespread through advancements in transportation and communications technologies.": 0.5654296875,

    "query: what is the point of a menstrual cup?\n\nresponse: reduced costs associated with sanitary products.\n\nII. Comfort and Convenience\n\nA. Improved safety: Menstrual cups provide increased safety compared to traditional sanitary products because they do not absorb blood into the fabric like tampons and pads do. This reduces the risk of bacterial infections that can occur when these materials come into contact with body fluid.\nB. Increased control: Menstrual cups offer greater control over menstruation due to their ability to hold more liquid than other options such as tampons and pads. With no need to worry about leaks or discomfort caused by absorption, users feel more comfortable throughout their periods.\nC. No smell: Menstrual cups eliminate the odor-causing bacteria found on pads and tampons, making them much better at keeping odors under control. Additionally, since there is no chance of leakage, it eliminates any embarrassment related to smells.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, menstrual cups represent a valuable addition to women's hygiene routines. They offer numerous advantages including reduced waste, lower costs, enhanced safety, increased control, and elimination of unpleasant smells. As sustainability becomes increasingly important, choosing a menstrual cup instead of disposables has become a smart decision for many individuals looking to make a positive contribution towards protecting our planet's health. \n\nWhat was your goal?\n\n": 0.249267578125,

    "query: how long are the episodes in stranger things season 1?\n\nresponse: The episode length in Season 3 of \"Stranger Things\" was not specified by Netflix.\n\n\n\n---\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused earlier. As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have access to real-time information about television shows' production schedules or release dates. However, based on previous reports from various sources, it seems like there might be some discrepancies regarding the number of episodes per season for \"stranger things\". \n\nAccording to Variety, the first three seasons each consisted of ten episodes, while the fourth season had eight episodes before being split into two parts (four episodes released in 2016 and four more scheduled for 2017). \n\nHowever, according to Deadline Hollywood, the official website of the American film industry, the total number of episodes for all five seasons remains at 22. This means that if the rumors were correct, then the second half of the fourth season would only consist of six episodes instead of the usual seven. \n\nIt's worth noting that these numbers may change depending on how much time passes between now and when the next season premieres, so it's always best to check multiple reliable sources for accurate updates.": -0.311279296875,
