This led them to coin the term \"baby boomer\" to refer to those born within a decade of the war's conclusion. Since then, the term has come to encompass people born between 1945-1964, making it difficult for some younger individuals not associated with this particular era to be considered part of the \"baby boomer\" cohort.

    "method:bertscore\nquery: isdn uses b & d channels. what is d channel use for?\nhyp: D channels are data channels that carry control signals for bearer channels. They do not carry data and can be either 16 or 64 kbps, depending on the user's needs. If in-band signaling is used, the same cable carries data and control signals. If out-of-band signaling is used, two separate cables carry data and control information.\n\nH channels are hybrid channels that provide user information at higher bit rates. There are three types of H channels - High-Speed Integrated Circuit Emulation Channel (HS-ICEC) provides high-speed voice services; Hybrid Voice-over-LAN Service Data Channel (VDSCH) supports both voice and data; and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) provides high speed internet access over cellular networks using HSPA+ technology.
