This information can be found from the given paragraph where it mentions \"They have also announced...\" followed by an explanation about their upcoming schedule which includes Georgia Tech as well as other teams mentioned earlier such as NC State, Duke, Wake Forest etc., all of which had already been announced before this statement. Therefore, we know that UMI's opponent list now only contains Georgia Tech after this announcement has taken place. Hence, yes to option 2. Question: What team does UMI plan to face next? \nExplanation: From the same paragraph, \"UCLA vs. Florida Atlantic (Sept. 15); Auburn vs. Boston College (Sept. 22).\" So, based on what is stated here, UMI plans to take on either UCLA or FSU in its next match.

    "query: who sings war don't let me down?\n\nresponse: \"Don't Let Me Down\" is a song written by John Lennon and George Harrison from their respective solo albums \"Let It Be\" (1970) and \"All Things Must Pass\" (1971). The track features backing vocals by Ringo Starr and was recorded in late 1970 at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nThe lyrics express John Lennon's deep affection towards Yoko Ono and his need for her companionship during difficult times. He writes about wanting to be able to rely on her just like they could count on each other before she left them. \n\nSpector's decision not to include \"Don't Let Me Down\" on the initial release of \"The Beatles\" may have been due to creative differences within the band itself. However, it's worth noting that there were several versions of the recording available prior to its final version being chosen for inclusion on \"Let It Be.\" \n\nOverall, while some fans speculate that \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" had more space for this particular composition, others believe that Spector simply chose another cut based on personal preference rather than any specific reasoning beyond artistic vision. Regardless, \"Don't Let Me Down\" remains an enduring tribute to John Lennon's romantic feelings toward Yoko Ono and serves as a poignant reminder of the power dynamics present in relationships both past and present.": 0.170654296875,

    "query: the temperature of gas is proportional to the?\n\nresponse: pressure\n\nThe temperature of gas is not necessarily proportional to its pressure.\n\nIn general, the relationship between pressure (P), volume (V), mass (m) and temperature (T) for an ideal gas is:\n\nPV = nRT,\n\nwhere R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor example, if we have 1 liter of air at standard conditions (1 atmosphere and 273.15 degrees Celsius), it contains approximately 0.02 mole of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. (This assumes that there were no changes in composition during storage.)\n\nTo find out how much of each molecule was added/removed from the system when the pressure was changed by 2 times more than before, we can use the law of conservation of mass:\n\n(n + 2nR)(dV/dt)\n\n= -d(mv) / dt - d(nv) / dt, \n\nwhich simplifies to: \n\n((n+1/2)v^2/R)((2n+2/3)p^3/R) \n\n\nWe know that:\n\ndp dv dp v p V P V n m t t T T Q W S F B C D I O U Y Z A L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E G H J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D F I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D F I J K L": -0.52587890625,

Pacemaker is a medical device used for cardiac rhythm management rather than targeting specific organs within the human anatomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Body Organs: None specified by text provided. The pacemaker is primarily designed as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) intended to treat supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation/ventricular flutter without affecting other vital organs such as lungs, liver, kidneys etc., making no direct reference to any specific organ associations. However, some patients may experience complications related to infection at the site where the lead was inserted into their chest cavity, leading to inflammation around the area known as endocarditis, but this condition typically requires prompt treatment and antibiotics prescribed under doctor’s orders. \n\nIt should be noted that while there might have been previous references made regarding certain potential risks or side effects associated with pacemakers, these were likely oversimplifications based upon limited data from early clinical trials and case reports, and they do not reflect current understanding of the safety profile of modern pacemakers. As technology continues to advance, more research will undoubtedly shed light on new aspects of pacemaker use and patient outcomes over time. \nIt's important to note that pacemakers work differently depending on the type of pacing mode selected by the user; therefore, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider before selecting a pacemaker model that's best suited for you given individual health conditions, lifestyle factors, and personal preferences.
