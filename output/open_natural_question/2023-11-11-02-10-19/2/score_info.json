This information can be found from the given paragraph where it mentions \"They have also announced...\" followed by an explanation about their upcoming schedule which includes Georgia Tech as well as other teams mentioned earlier such as NC State, Duke, Wake Forest etc., all of which had already been announced before this statement. Therefore, we know that UMI's opponent list now only contains Georgia Tech after this announcement has taken place. Hence, yes to option 2. Question: What team does UMI plan to face next? \nExplanation: From the same paragraph, \"UCLA vs. Florida Atlantic (Sept. 15); Auburn vs. Boston College (Sept. 22).\" So, based on what is stated here, UMI plans to take on either UCLA or FSU in its next match.

[/INST] [INST] I apologize for my previous response. As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have physical bodies and therefore cannot physically locate specific parts of my body such as bones.\nIn terms of general anatomy, humans typically have 206 bones in their skeletal system, which is made up of two main parts: the axial skeleton (neck, spine, and pelvis) and appendicular skeleton (arms and legs). The number of bones can vary slightly between individuals based on factors like genetics and growth patterns.\nHowever, it's important to note that this statement from the given paragraph may not necessarily apply to all people, since bone density and distribution can differ depending on various factors including age, gender, health status, etc.\nTo answer the original question: \"Where are more than half your bones located\" without referring specifically to any particular person's bones would depend on personal characteristics and variations within human populations. It could potentially refer to certain regions of the body where bones tend to cluster together due to structural reasons or functional demands. However, without further context or information, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. [/INST] [INST] Score the faithfulness and helpfulness range from -1 to 1 [/INST]",
